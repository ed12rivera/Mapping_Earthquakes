# Mapping_Earthquakes

The purpose of this project is to map recent earthquake activity around the globe.  The earthquakes are plotted along with an outline of Earth's tectonic plates.  We will be using Javascript, the d3 and leaflet libraries, and will map our data onto a mapbox map using an api request.
